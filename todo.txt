TODOs:
- figure out if we can create reports with disabled feature flags (we should validate on the server if the users can access the feature flag)
- photos component will not display photo urls
- bulk actions select all checkbox does not select all, bulk delete isn't implemented.
- readme commands don't work:
    - ~/featureflag/backend (main*) » ./vendor/bin/sail redis redis-cli KEYS "flag:*"
        (error) ERR unknown command 'redis-cli', with args beginning with: 'KEYS' 'flag:*'     
- tests don't actually run anything useful for now
- type-check doesn't exist
- lint


- simplify useFlags hook
- improve auth maybe
- flag controller duplicated (one of them is for debug purposes)
- redis cache double-check
- remove `backend/database/migrations/2026_01_31_210909_add_uuid_to_feature_flags.php` migration and just roll it into the create_users_table migration

- TZ for frontend
- README is outdated
- create script to launch the whole app
- script to run all tests
