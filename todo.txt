- figure out if we can create reports with disabled feature flags (we should validate on the server if the users can access the feature flag)
- photos component will not load photo urls
- bulk actions select all checkbox does not select all, bulk delete isn't implemented.
- readme commands don't work:
    - ~/featureflag/backend (main*) » ./vendor/bin/sail redis redis-cli KEYS "flag:*"                                                                                                                iaotle@hightemplar
        (error) ERR unknown command 'redis-cli', with args beginning with: 'KEYS' 'flag:*'     
- flag IDs should be uuid
- flag interactions can be done through flag names, instead of using flag IDs
- scheduler missing (we need something to call schedule:run, add docker-compose)
- tests don't actually run anything useful for now
- type-check doesn't exist
- lint
- !!!admin env is missing!!! (need simple login with management ui, password reset)
- useflags isLoading is not used anywhere (we should use SWR pattern when we use this hook, but without SWR dependency as it's too much for this POC project)


- logout doesn't do anything
- flags fail to fetch



- some flags don't have error message in the backend, for example priority_indicators, ai_damage_detection. when the frontend has stale flags, the server should inform the user with a message and a 403, and the frontend should display the error.
